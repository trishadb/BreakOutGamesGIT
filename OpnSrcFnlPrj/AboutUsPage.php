        <p id="h1">About Real Escape Game</p>

        <p id="p">Real Escape Game, designed and developed in Japan in 2007, has arrived to Canada for the first time.</p>
        <p id="p">In 2006, as Takao Kato was sitting in class, he looked over his friend 's shoulder and saw her playing a game on her PC. The game involved pointing and clicking her mouse around a virtual room to reveal clues needed to unlock the front door. This was and is a widely popular PC game genre called Room Escape.</p>
        <p id="p">Takao was intrigued by this, and began imagining how this experience might play out in real life. One year later, he launched the Real Escape game.</p>
        <p id="p">Today, over 10,000,000 participants have played this game in Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the United States. Only 3% of participants have made their way out.</p>
        <p id="p">In a time of digital overload, the Real Escape Game introduces an interactive analog gaming experience, where the right measure of wit, persistence and teamwork win the game. Scrap Entertainment has partnered with Company & Company to bring the Real Escape Game to Canada for the very first time.</p>
